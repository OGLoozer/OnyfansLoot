## Installation
1. Download OnyFans Loot
2. Unzip
3. Rename the unzipped folder to "OnyfansLoot"
4. Copy or cut the now renamed "OnyfansLoot" and paste it into Interface\AddOns

*** 5-6 is now optional. The addon will now grab updated lists from guildmates in game ***

5. Move RenameMeToJustOnyfansLoot.lua to  '\WTF\Account\Account Name\SavedVariables'
6. Rename RenameMeToJustOnyfansLoot.lua to OnyfansLoot.lua
7. Restart World of Warcraft 

## Limitations
- If any of the items in the loot list or master loot list are misspelled this won't work
- For now, this does not update the list when people get items from their list
- Every time the list is updated the OnyfansLoot.lua in '\WTF\Account\Account Name\SavedVariables' needs to be updated
    - By at least one person and then the addon will propagate it
