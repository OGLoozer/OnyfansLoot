Installation
Download OnyFans Loot
Unzip
Rename the unzipped folder to "OnyfansLoot"
Copy or cut the now renamed "OnyfansLoot" and paste it into Interface\AddOns
Restart World of Warcraft
Wait for someone in game to propagate the list to you (most likely me)

Limitations
If any of the items in the loot list or master loot list are misspelled this won't work
For now, this does not update the list when people get items from their list
Every time the list is updated the OnyfansLoot.lua in '\WTF\Account\Account Name\SavedVariables' needs to be updated
Only one person needs to update it. Then they'll propagate it to everyone else
